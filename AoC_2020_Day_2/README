            where
                n1:   the lowest number of time c must appear for valid password
                n2:   the highest number of time c must appear for valid password
                c:    a valid character in the password PASS
                PASS: the valid/invalid PASSWORD

            where
                n1:   position one of the password
                n2:   position two of the password
                c:    the given letter

4. Run the program
    cd AoC_2020_Day_2
    make run

5. Run the tests
    cd AoC_2020_Day_2

6. Future improvements
    Remove duplicated code by combining src/Day_2_1.py and src/Day_2_2.py into src/Day_2.py

    Advantages:
        removal of duplicated code

    Disadvantages:
        more complex class and function
