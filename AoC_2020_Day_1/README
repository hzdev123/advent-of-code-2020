2. Summary
    2.1 Day-1-1
        Given a list of integers:
            Return the product of two list entries that sum up to 2020.

            A + B = 2020
            A * B = ???

            Ans: ???

    2.2 Day-1-2
        Given a list of integers:
            Return the product of three list entries that sum up to 2020.

            A + B + C = 2020
            A * B * C = ???

            Ans: ???

3. Example

        1721
        979
        366
        299
        675
        1456

        1721 + 299 = 2020
        1721 * 299 = 514579

        Ans: 514579

    3.2 Day-1-2
        1721
        979
        366
        299
        675
        1456

        979 + 366 + 675 = 2020
        979 * 366 * 675 = 241861950

6. Discussion
    cd AoC_2020_Day_1
    make compare
        to see a graph which compares the brute force approach with position tracking approach.

    The trivial solution is to compare every list entry with eachother to find the sum.

    The solution used is an improvement where we keep track of already visited list entries so that we avoid duplicated additions.

    The Position Tracking solution is as following.

            etc

            based on the above examples the below conclusions are drawn:

                Number of operations for worst case scenario:
                    Compare every list element with eachother:
                        f(n) = n^2

                    Use Position Tracking to avoid duplicated operations:
                        f(n) = sum(range(1, n))

                        1 is used in range instead of 0 because 0 does not add anything.

7. Future improvements

    An improvement could be:
        first sort the list entries from lowest to highest
        find a pivot element
        from the pivot element
            compare the list entries A and B:
                A: lowest to pivot element
                B: pivot element to highest
