2. Summary:
    2.1 Day 3-1
        Given a pattern:
            start on top left open square
            move 3 right, 1 down
            move until below bottom-most row is passed
            count number of trees encountered

    2.2 Day 3-2
        Similar to 2.1 Day 3-1 but for different number of steps to the right and down.
        The steps are:
            Right 1, down 1.
            Right 3, down 1. (Solved in 2.1 Day 3-1)
            Right 5, down 1.
            Right 7, down 1.
            Right 1, down 2.

        Return the product of the number of trees encountered.

3. Example:
    3.1 Day 3-1
        . = Open square
        # = Tree

        Base pattern:

        Answer: 7 trees encountered.

    3.2 Day 3-2
        Similar to 3.1 Day 3-1 but for different number of steps to the right, down.

            Right 1, down 1. -> 2 trees encountered
            Right 3, down 1. -> 7 trees encountered
            Right 5, down 1. -> 3 trees encountered
            Right 7, down 1. -> 4 trees encountered
            Right 1, down 2. -> 2 trees encountered

        The answer is: 2 * 7 * 3 * 4 * 2 = 336
